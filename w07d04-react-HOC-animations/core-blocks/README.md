Create a ToDo app(2.0) again by adding transition effect such that

- when the new item is added, prepare the item for the animation. In this case, set its opacity to `0` and transition the opacity of the element from `0` to `1`
- when the item is removed from the list, transition the opacity of the element from 1 to 0 over a period of time and remove the element once the transition has completed.

Look at the [demo](https://restlessbit.github.io/react-transition-demo/index.html)

## Release 1
